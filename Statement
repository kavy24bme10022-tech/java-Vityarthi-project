# Expense Tracker – Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Managing personal finances can be challenging without a simple tool to record daily income and expenses.  
Most existing solutions are either too complex, require installation, or depend on cloud accounts.

categorize, and review their financial transactions using a clean and intuitive interface.
